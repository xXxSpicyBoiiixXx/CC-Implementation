# Introduction

The language we will be using is called Lax through the book...this should be interesting...

A compiler-compiler is a compiler that spits out a compiler basically. e.g. Lex and Yacc do this. 

Yacc stands for "Yet another Compiler-Compiler" 

We will start with jlox... 

So jlox is a Java implemented interpreter, so it would be great to start with. 

You can implement a la compiler in any language even in the same langague which is called self hosting. Now you can use your own compiled code to compile the code itself in a process called bootstraping. 

The second part will be in C whcih can be a bit funnier...
